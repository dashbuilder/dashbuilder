         This context.xml causes Tomcat to insert Weld's CDI BeanManager into
         the JNDI context at java:/comp/env/BeanManager. This is required in
         Tomcat because Weld's normal boostrap doesn't work: the JNDI context
         is read-only to the webapp.

         For details on deploying Weld into Tomcat, see
         http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/1.0.0/en-US/html/environments.html
