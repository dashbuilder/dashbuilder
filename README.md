DashBuilder project is active and innovating at a fast pace! But how can I keep you with the new features?

First, we have a new blog home [blog.kie.org](https://blog.kie.org/). This blog is the best place to keep you updated with new features.

You can also check out this [blog post](https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/dashbuilder-an-apache-licensed-business-reporting-and-monitoring-tool.html) to see a summary of the most exciting DashBuilder new features or follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://blog.kie.org/2021/05/dashbuilder-getting-started-guide.html).

The source code of this project is living mostly on [Appformer](https://github.com/kiegroup/appformer). The dashbuilder-dataset modules have moved to [kie-soup](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-soup)
