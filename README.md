Build & run
===========

Prerequisites
-------------
* Git client
* Maven 3.2.5+
* Java 1.6+

First steps
-----------

Clone the project

    git clone git@github.com:dashbuilder/dashbuilder.git

Now you can build & run the project in development or production mode.

Development mode
----------------

Development mode allows a user to develop with the framework by compiling classes and client assets on runtime, which decreases the development time. There are more implications such as browser compatibilities, language support, etc. It's useful for developing and testing the application.

Dashbuilder is currently built using GWT 2.7, so you are forced to use [SuperDevMode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html) to run the application.

Super development mode is the new way to work in GWT since version <code>2.5</code> (Native support & the default mode in GWT <code>2.7</code>).
It works in most new browsers and it's based on [Source Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1&pli=1) spec. It's faster and more efficient than the old hosted mode. There are lots of benefits and other important reasons to use it, you can find more information [here](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html).

Dashbuilder supports and it's configured by default to use SuperDevMode.

Using it means running two servers, one for the web application and one for the Code Server that compiles classes for SDM when the compile button is pushed on the web page or in the bookmark.

To build the application:

    cd dashbuilder
    mvn clean install -DskipTests

To run it:

    cd dashbuilder-webapp
    mvn gwt:run

Login:

    admin / admin


(If you are an IntelliJ fan, we also provide a setup for running the application under this fantastic IDE. Details [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dashbuilder-development/tRa6AAMb8fM))

Production mode
---------------

Production mode is used to build & package the application for a production environment. The application is compiled and the javascript assets are build using all permutations (browser support), all languages, etc.

In order to build the production mode:

    cd dashbuilder
    mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dfull

Once build is finished, you'll find the WAR distributions for Wildfly and Tomcat into <code>dashbuilder/dashbuilder-distros/target/</code>.

Just deploy the WAR file into your application server!
